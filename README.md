Both python scripts are jupyter notebook files which can found in the "Mars" folder. The csv file containing the dataframe created in the second python script is titled "mars_df" and is located in the "Output" folder.

In order to estimate the length of a Martian year in the second part of the assignment, I first visually inspected the plot of minimum temperature over time and made a rough estimate regarding the days where minimum temperature was at its lowest. I then looked through the dataframe to find the exact day where the termperature peaks occurred and used these days as the basis for my calculation.
